How to use ACFTools? Well... My GUI programming skills are poor, so
ACFTools is, as most of my programs, command-line. You can write it
in any folder. For example, C:\ACFTools of C:\X-Plane\ACFTools. But
you may operate it from DOS prompt. Remember this buddy from ancient
computing days? :)
If not, here is brief usage explanation. Go to
"Start->Run", type "command" and press
"OK". This will open black screen which is better seen when
configured to have 80x50 characters-wide. There, you type: "cd
C:\ACFTools" or whatever directory ACFTools is located. There,
type "acftools" (note that "acftools",
"acftools.exe" and "acftools.pl" may be different
files but they do refer the same thing: main ACFTools executable).
That screen that appears is parameter list. Now, for extract good old
747, type:

acftools --extract --acffile="C:\X-Plane\Aircraft\HeavyMetal\B747-400 United\United-Air.acf" --txtfile 747.txt

This will start conversion from ACF to TXT & AC3D formats. Lots of
stuff are dumped to screen. When process is finished, "Press
<RETURN> to exit" appears. At this point, 747.txt & 747.ac
files were created. 747.txt is plaintext detailed description of 747
aircraft. It's HUGE: 5 Mb! Then, 747.ac is AC3D model of 747. Just
open it in AC3D and have a lot of fun :)
Note that you may separate body you wish to edit into separate file.
For example, select "body[47]" group, copy it and paste in
new file: "body.ac". Then edit it as you wish. Note that
you can't add nor delete vertices/surfaces. This is enormous
limitation imposed by X-Plane itself.
When you want to IMPORT edited model back to ACF file, do following:

Step 1:
acftools --merge --ac3dfile=body.ac --txtfile 747.txt
Step 2:
acftools --generate --txtfile 747.txt --acffile 747.acf

Sometimes resulting file is weirdly broken, this is because my
merging algorithm is poor :(
To avoid that use "--noorder" parameter:

acftools --merge --ac3dfile=body.ac --txtfile 747.txt --noorder

Unfortunately ACFTools stills very ugly and difficult to use piece of
software. Even me, it's author, suffered several hours to try to
import cool duct fans into X-Plane. I hope to expand ACFTools in
brief future!
