Useful template and just sample models.

Templates:

 * 'fusepipe.ac' is the first thing Plane-Maker creates for you. Do whatever
   you want with it in AC3D, and then import to ACF.
   (always remember to not to add nor delete vertices/surfaces!)
 * 'wheel.ac' 1x1x1 cylinder that you can rescale to desired size and make
   aircraft tires. Useful until ACFTools get "gear extractor" feature :)

Samples:

 * '747.ac' - Boeing 747-400 from 'Aircraft/Heavy Metal'
 * 'Columbia.ac' - Columbia 400 from 'Aircraft/General Aviation'
   (pay attention to propeller blades :)
 * 'SpaceShipOne.ac' - two-in-one: 'White Knight' with attached
   'Space Ship One' from 'Aircraft/Space Ships'

NOTE: you CAN'T import parts from samples to ACF as they are optimized!
