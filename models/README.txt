Useful template and just sample models.

Templates:

 * 'fusepipe.ac' is the first thing Plane-Maker creates for you. Do whatever
   you want with it in AC3D, and then import to ACF. (this one has 20 sections!)
   (always remember to not to add nor delete vertices/surfaces!)
 * 'wheel.ac' 1x1x1 cylinder that you can rescale to desired size and make
   aircraft tires. Useful until ACFTools get "gear extractor" feature :)

Samples:

 * '747.ac' - Boeing 747-400 from 'Aircraft/Heavy Metal'
 * 'Columbia.ac' - Columbia 400 from 'Aircraft/General Aviation'
   (pay attention to propeller blades :)
 * 'Seabee.ac' - Republic RC-3 "Superbee" (model by Tracy Walker)
 * 'SpaceShipOne.ac' - two-in-one: 'White Knight' with attached
   'Space Ship One' from 'Aircraft/Space Ships' (model by Curt Boyll)

NOTE: you CAN'T import parts from samples to ACF as they are optimized!
